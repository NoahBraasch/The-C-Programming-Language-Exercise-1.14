# The-C-Programming-Language-Exercise-1.14
This is my example of exercise 1.14 as defined in the book "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie The exercise is defined as such: "Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input."

For this exercise, it is important to have basic familiaarity with the table of ASCII characters, which can be found on Google.
